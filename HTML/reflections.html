					<h3 class="reflection_title">My reflections About this Class</h3>
					<h2 class="reflection_bigtittle">And How Happy I am to learn Web development</h2>
					<div class="reflection_text">
						<p>I started Web Applications and Cloud Developer degree program. This is my first class at Edmonds
							Community College, and I am excited that I made this choise.
						</p>
						<p>In this course, I learned a lot about HTML5, CSS3 and a bit of JavaScript language. We had a discussion
							board where we compared notes and understanding of the class topics during the class. We also had tests
							and labs which improved and tested our knowledge. These acquired skills helped me complete the Final
							Project. It consisted of making a Portfolio Web site. It was challenging but very satisfying when I was
							done.
						</p>
						<p>In my opinion, there are a few things that I would improve in this class. The first thing would be to add
							a video section with an instructor or video lectures. Students have to connect to each other and the
							instructor to ask questions to better understand the material. Typically, the instructor explains more
							clearly than a textbook. The second thing I would improve is to add more resources. We only had a textbook
							and CIW website, many times during the class, I had to use Google for additional information. </p>
						<p>I am looking forward to the next class!
